//Punctuation.java
//This program outputs the words that contain punctuation given a string
/* 
 * Pseudocode: 
 * in main, call searchIt(), pass in text variable as parameter.
 * D&I start/end variable, iterate through each character until you find a space using getPunctuationWords().
 * if a space is found, then the word will be a substring from start to end.
 * check if the substring(word) has punctuation using the method checkForPunctuation() by 
 * going through all punctuation marks and seeing if they a match a letter from the word.
 * if the word has punctuation, add it to result.
 * set start to end.
 * at the end, print Punctuationwords(result) using the printWords() method by passing it in as a parameter.
